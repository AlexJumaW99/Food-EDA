# Food-EDA
Explaratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization was carried out on Global Food Data from Kaggle in order to gather insights. The various questions answered were as follows:
- What were the top 20 commodities sold globally over the years?
- What was the average price of all commodities sold in Kenya every year from 2006 to 2021?
- Has there been an increase or decrease in this price over the years?
- What was the median price of all commodities sold in Kenya every year?

# Insights
This is what was discovered from the data:
- The top 3 commodities sold globally were Millet, Imported Rice and Maize, respectively.
- The average price of all commodities sold in Kenya has doubled from the year 2006 to 2019. This could be attributed to a number of factors such as: inflation, an increased demand in the products or even higher production, storage and transportation costs.
